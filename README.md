# Comparison-Between-Binary-Search-And-Linear-Search-Using-ReactJs
ReactJS web app comparing Binary Search &amp; Linear Search. Visualize &amp; contrast search efficiency on sorted arrays. Educational project.
Description:
This repository contains a web application built with ReactJs that demonstrates a comparison between two popular searching algorithms: Binary Search and Linear Search. The project aims to provide an interactive platform for users to understand the differences in efficiency and performance between these two search methods when applied to a sorted array.

Key Features:

1. Binary Search Implementation: The project includes a well-optimized binary search algorithm for searching a target element within a sorted array.
2. Linear Search Implementation: A linear search algorithm is also implemented to compare its efficiency with binary search on the same dataset.
3. Visual Representation: The application offers a visually appealing representation of the search process for both algorithms, making it easier to grasp the steps involved in each method.
4. Performance Metrics: Users can observe and compare the number of comparisons and execution time taken by each search algorithm for different input scenarios.
5. User Interaction: The user can input their own array and target element to experience the differences in search performance firsthand.
6. Responsive Design: The ReactJs application is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.

Usage:
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm install or npx create-react-app(for only specific to this project).
3. Launch the development server with npm start.
4. Access the application through your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Contributions:
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.Also GitHub wont let me upload # node_modules folder as it was way larger for the Github. 

Note:
The project is intended for educational purposes, highlighting the characteristics of binary search and linear search algorithms in a ReactJs environment. It is not intended for production use.

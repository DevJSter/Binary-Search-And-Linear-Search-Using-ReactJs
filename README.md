# Binary Search vs. Linear Search: A Visual Comparison - ReactJS Web App

## Overview

Welcome to **"Binary Search vs. Linear Search: A Visual Comparison"** - an educational ReactJS web application that showcases a side-by-side comparison of two popular searching algorithms: Binary Search and Linear Search. This project aims to provide an interactive platform for users to understand the differences in efficiency and performance between these search methods when applied to sorted arrays.

## Key Features

1. **Binary Search Implementation:** The project includes a well-optimized binary search algorithm for searching a target element within a sorted array.

2. **Linear Search Implementation:** A linear search algorithm is also implemented to compare its efficiency with binary search on the same dataset.

3. **Visual Representation:** The application offers a visually appealing representation of the search process for both algorithms, making it easier to grasp the steps involved in each method.

4. **Performance Metrics:** Users can observe and compare the number of comparisons and execution time taken by each search algorithm for different input scenarios.

5. **User Interaction:** The user can input their own array and target element to experience the differences in search performance firsthand.

6. **Responsive Design:** The ReactJS application is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.
